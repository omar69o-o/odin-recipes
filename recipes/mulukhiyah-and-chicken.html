    <h3> <pre>Molokhia gets its name from a dark leafy green of the same name. Also known as Jew's mallow,
it develops an okra-like viscosity when cooked and is an acquired taste for some. In Lebanon,
writer Salma Abdelnour grew up eating molokhia served with crispy pita croutons
and a drizzle of dressing made with red wine vinegar and onion.
But Egyptians often serve the dish without these garnishes, as in this recipe from Eric Monkaba
